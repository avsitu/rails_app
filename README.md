Ruby version 2.3.4

This is a demonstration of web development using the Ruby on Rails framework. 
This application currently allows a user to:
- Set up and log into an account
- Create short text posts that appear on their profile
- Follow other users to receive a chronological feed of their posts
- "Like" posts by other users to create a collection of favorite posts (WIP) 

You can check out a production version of the application on Heroku:
